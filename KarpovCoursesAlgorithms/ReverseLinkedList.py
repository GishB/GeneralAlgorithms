Task â„– 4.

Yoy have one direction sequence. You need to rotate its values by k position.

Your task is to write function rotate_right(head, k) which return expected list.

Limitations:
    1. You have to work with one list. You can`t create a new one!
    2. You have to switch connections inside the list.
    3. Class Node will represent the one direction sequence object.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

For example:
    1.
        head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        k = 2
        return [4, 5, 1, 2, 3, ]
