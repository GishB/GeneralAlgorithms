# Algorithm tasks on Python ~ 3.8

This pet project contains algorithm tasks from three different platforms as CodeWars, Yandex.Contests, Karpov.Courses.

Main idea of the project is to save algorithm for future training and education purposes.

Structure:
- CodeWarsAlgorithms: contains tasks from the platform without any special split in jupyter notebook.
- YandexAlgorithms: contains tasks divided on years and special events.
- KarpovCoursesAlgorithms: contains tasks in .py format without any special split.


In the future the project will be extended and all dir will have .py files with tasks and implementations as well as tests.
